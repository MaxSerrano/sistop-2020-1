[Self-driving car dilemmas reveal that moral choices are not universal](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07135-0)

Self-driving cars might soon will have to make ethical judgments on their own; however, settling a universal moral code for the vehicles could be a hard task. The largest survey of machine ethics finds that the moral principles that guide a driver's decicions vary by country and according to Iyad Rahwan, computer scientist at MIT, *"[...] there are no universal rules"* for setting an ethic guide.

Online experimental platform designed to explore the moral dilemmas faced by autonomous vehicles. This platform gathered 40 million decisions in ten languages from millions of people in 233 countries. 

1. Global moral preferences: 
2. Document individual variations in preferences: 
3. Report cross cultural ethical variation (three major clusters of countries): 
4. These differences correlate with modern institutions and deep cultural traits: 

Autonomous vehicles will cruise our roads soon, necessitating agreement on the principles that should apply when life-threatening dilemmas emerge.

Some of the conclusions suggests that geographical and cultural proximity may allow groups of territories to converge on shared preferences for machine ethics. 

Discussion: **"never in the history of humanity have we allowed a machine to autonomously decide who should live and who should die [...] (and) before we allow our cars to make ethical decisions, we need to have global conversation to express our preferences to the companies that will design moral algorithms, and to the policymakes that will regulate them."** -

**Location**: mapping software uses GPS data to tell the car whre it is in relation to roads, traffic signals and other landmarks. 

**Route planning**: an on-board computer uses sensor data to plot a route that gets the car where it needs to go, while avoiding people, potholes and other vehicles. 

**Perception**: vehicles use radar to detect obstacles, a laser ranging system to map the surroundings in three dimensions and video cameras to identify objects such as traffic lights, construction signs, pedestrians and other vehicles. 

**Communication**: Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) radios send signals between cars, trucks and infrastructure items such as traffic lights. 

**Road trains**: vehicles can take advantage of aerodynamics and save fuel by following one another almost bumper to bumper. 

**Decision and action**: to make the appropiate responses to rare events the cars rely on algorithms refined through millions of kilometers of test drives. 

**Adaptive traffic flow**: smart infrastructure integrates V2V signals from the moving cars to optimize speed limits, traffic-light timing and the number of lanes in each direction on the bassis of the actual traffic load. 

**Mass transport**: driverless version of the ride sharing service.
